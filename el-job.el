;;; Commentary:

;; Imagine you have a function you'd like to run on a long list of inputs.  You
;; could run (mapcar #'FN INPUTS), but that hangs Emacs until done.

;; This library gives you the tools to split up the inputs and run the function
;; in many subprocesses (one per CPU core), then merges their outputs and
;; passes it back to the current Emacs.  In the meantime, current Emacs does
;; not hang at all.

;; The only public API is the function `el-job-launch'.

  "Run FUNCALL in one or more headless Elisp processes.
Then merge the return values \(lists of N lists) into one list
\(of N lists) and pass it to WRAPUP.

i.e. each subprocess may return lists like

process 1: \((city1 city2) (road1) (museum1 museum2))
process 2: \((city3 city4 city5) (road2) (museum3))
process 3: ...

but at the end, these lists are merged into a single list shaped just like
any one of those above, with the difference that the sublists have more
elements:

\((city1 city2 city3 city4 city5)
  (road1 road2)
  (museum1 museum2 museum3))

which is why it's important that FUNCALL always returns a list with a
fixed number of sub-lists, enabling this merge.  Of course, these
sub-lists are allowed to be empty, i.e. nil.

Alternatively, FUNCALL may always return nil.


FUNCALL is a function symbol known to be defined in an Emacs Lisp file.
It is the only mandatory argument, but rarely useful on its own.

Usually, you would need to pass the symbol LOAD to indicate where to
find that Emacs Lisp file; that file should end with a `provide' call on
the same symbol.  LOAD can also be a list of several symbols.

While subprocesses do not inherit `load-path', it is the mother Emacs
process that locates that file \(by inspecting `load-history', via
`el-job--ensure-compiled-lib'), then gives the file to the subprocess.

Due to the absence of `load-path', be careful writing `require'
statements into that Emacs Lisp file.  You can pass `load-path' via
INJECT-VARS, but consider that fewer dependencies means faster spin-up.


INPUTS is a list that will be split by up to the output of
`num-processors', and this determines how many subprocesses will spawn.
If INPUTS is omitted, only one subprocess will spawn.

The subprocesses have no access to current Emacs state.  The only way
they can affect current state, is if FUNCALL returns data, which is then
handled by WRAPUP function in the current Emacs.

Emacs stays responsive to user input up until all subprocesses finish,
which is when their results are merged and WRAPUP is executed.

WRAPUP receives two arguments: the results as mentioned before, and the
job object.  The latter is mainly useful to check timestamps,
which you can get from this form:

    \(el-job:timestamps JOB)


ID identifies this job, and is a symbol, a keyword or an integer below
536,870,911 \(suitable for `eq').  A non-nil ID has several purposes:

- Allow the processes to stay alive in the background after completion,
  to skip spin-up time on next call.
  May make a difference if they load a lot of libraries.
  This does not apply if METHOD is `reap'. See `el-job-default-method'.

- Allow repeated calls on the same inputs to optimize how those inputs
  are split, thanks to benchmarks from previous calls.
  If needed, you can inhibit this by setting SKIP-BENCHMARK non-nil.

- The associated process buffers stick around and can be inspected for
  debugging purposes.  Seek buffer names that start with \" *el-job-\"
  \(note leading space).

- Prevent launching the same job twice, if the last invocation is not
  done yet.  Argument IF-BUSY regulates what happens instead, see below.


IF-BUSY comes into effect when the previous launch with the same ID is
still at work.  IF-BUSY may take on one of three symbols:

- `wait' \(default): append the inputs to a queue, to be handled
                     after all children are ready
- `noop': do nothing, drop inputs
- `takeover': kill and restart with the new inputs


EVAL-ONCE is a string containing a Lisp form.  It is evaluated in the
child just before FUNCALL, but only once, even though FUNCALL may be
evaluated many times."
