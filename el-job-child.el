;;; Commentary:

;; The part of the codebase that child processes will need, and no more.

;;; Code:

;; We use `time-convert' instead of `current-time' because
;; 1. (TICKS . HZ) is fewer cons cells than (HIGH LOW USEC PSEC)
;; 2. (TICKS . HZ) will be future default
;; 3. If we used `current-time', we may have to inject `current-time-list'
;;    to be sure about behavior
